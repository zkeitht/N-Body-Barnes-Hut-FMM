# N-Body-Barnes-Hut-FMM
N-body simulation using Hierarchical Methods: the Barnes-Hut Algorithm and the Fast Multipole Method (FMM)

Important packages: 

    classes/     # to create objects: grid, particle, box

    functions/   # the BH and FMM algorithms

    simulations/ # uses the functions to operate on the objects under varying conditions

See Hierarchical N-body simulation.ipynb for a report on an exploration of the hierarchical methods and examples of how to use the code. A summary of the repository layout is also given in the introductory subsection of the report.
