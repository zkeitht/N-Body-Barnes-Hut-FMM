# N-Body-Barnes-Hut-FMM
N-body simulation using Hierarchical Methods: the Barnes-Hut Algorithm and the Fast Multipole Method (FMM)

Important packages: classes, helperfunctions, and simulations.

See Hierarchical N-body simulation.ipynb for a report on an exploration of the hierarchical methods and examples of how to use the code.
